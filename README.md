# Gender-Based Violence (GBV)

Gender-based violence (GBV) remains a significant challenge in Nigeria, particularly in rural and underserved communities. Many survivors face barriers to reporting incidents due to stigma, fear, or lack of accessible reporting mechanisms. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) can help address this gap by providing a safe, anonymous, and efficient way to report and analyze incidents of GBV.
